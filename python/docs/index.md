# Sara Python API

Welcome to the Python documentation.

The Python library is divided into 3 subcollections of libraries:

- Sara
- Shakti
- Brahma

## Sara

Sara Python code contains (for the most part):

- Python/C++ bindings
- Graphics API using PySide6
- lots of unpolished yet useful code
- C++ code generator to solve gold standard algorithms in epipolar geometry

## Shakti

Shakti contains at the moment:

- accelerated low-level algorithms (CPU and GPU), that runs much faster than the
  Gold standard implementations (OpenCV).
- optimized inference models (NVIDIA TensorRT and Apple CoreML at the moment)

## Brahma

Brahma contains training pipelines for various learning tasks.
