Welcome to Sara's documentation!
================================

*Sara* is a small and easy-to-use C++ computer vision library.

*Sara* (सार) is a *Sanskrit* word meaning *essence*. On a less serious note, I was
looking for a nice simple *human* name and the Spanish transliteration into this
lovely female name was then chosen intentionally.

Sara focuses on:

1. having an **easy-to-use and simple API**,
2. having **human-readable and efficient** implementations of computer vision
   algorithms,
3. **rigorous testing**.

2.0 <https://github.com/DO-CV/DO-CV/raw/master/COPYING.MPL2>`_.


The documentation chooses to emphasize more on the mathematical details to
explain some algorithmic implementation. I believe that my API is most of the
time straightforward enough. The audience I am targeting here is students,
scientists or software developers who want to understand those kind of details.

For the reference API documentation, refer to the **Doxygen**-based
documentation hosted `here at Codedocs.xyz`_:
