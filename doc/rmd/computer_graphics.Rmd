A few notes about elements of computer graphics.

## Framebuffer

As explained in a nice StackOverflow post, a framebuffer in OpenGL and in Vulkan
is not a buffer object but rather should be viewed as a *collection of
references to buffer objects*. Here, a buffer should be understood as an array
of bytes.

To set things straight in our mind, a framebuffer can be seen as a **C struct** object as follows.

```cpp
   struct Framebuffer
   {
     void *color_buffer = nullptr;
     void *depth_buffer = nullptr;
     void *stencil_buffer = nullptr;
   };

   using FramebufferId = Framebuffer *;
```

Pursuing this explanation, we can understand:

- *a color attachment* as a pointer to the color buffer object.
- *binding a color attachment to the framebuffer object* as assigning the
  pointer of a color buffer object to the `color_buffer` data member.

And likewise for *depth* and *stencil* attachments.
