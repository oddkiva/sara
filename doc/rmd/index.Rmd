# Welcome {-}

*Sara* is a small and easy-to-use C++ computer vision library.

*Sara* (सार) is a *Sanskrit* word meaning *essence*. On a less serious note, I was
looking for a nice simple *human* name and the Spanish transliteration into this
lovely female name was then chosen intentionally.

Sara focuses on:

1. having an **easy-to-use and simple API**,
2. having **human-readable and efficient** implementations of computer vision
   algorithms,
3. **rigorous testing**.

Sara is licensed with the _[Mozilla Public License version
2.0](https://gitlab.com/DO-CV/sara/-/blob/master/LICENSE)_.


The documentation chooses to emphasize more on the mathematical details to
explain some algorithmic implementation. I believe that my API is most of the
time straightforward enough. The audience I am targeting here is students,
scientists or software developers who want to understand those kind of details.

For the reference API documentation, refer to the **Doxygen**-based
documentation hosted at Codedocs.xyz: https://codedocs.xyz/DO-CV/sara/.

*N.B.: these notes reflect the best of my understanding as of this writing. They
may still contain errors and I am very interested to know about them if you spot
any misunderstandings on my part and explain to me.*
