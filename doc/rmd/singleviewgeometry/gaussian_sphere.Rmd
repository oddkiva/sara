## Vanishing Point

**THIS SECTION IS WIP**

In projective geometry, the projection of 3D lines in the camera film plane are
still line segments. However, the perspective projection does not preserve the
parallelism.

One remarkable property in projective geometry is that the projection of 3D
parallel lines onto an image plane is a set of 2D lines that intersect
altogether into a unique point: the so-called *vanishing point*.

### Terminology

Let us recall a bit of terminology.

- Any 3D scene point $X$ that lies in a 3D semi-line originating from the camera
  center $O$ **projects** exactly on a unique point $\mathbf{u}$ in the image
  plane.

We also like to say the other way around, in 3D reconstruction:

- A point $\mathbf{u}$ in the image plane **backprojects** to a 3D semi-line or
  equivalently to the 3D ray vector $\mathbf{r}_\mathbf{u}$ that parameterizes
  this semi-line.

Now let us take it further.

- a 2D line segment $(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b})$ in the image plane backprojects to
  a 3D half-plane $(\mathbf{O}, \mathbf{r}_\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{r}_\mathbf{b})$
  where $\mathbf{r}_\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{r}_\mathbf{b}$ are respectively the
  backprojected rays of the 2D image points $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$.

The backprojected 3D rays are the crux that will articulate our ideas about the
vanishing point.

Now it is more convenient this half-plane by the normal
$\mathbf{\Pi}(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b})$.

This can be calculated analytically as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\Pi}(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) =
\mathbf{r}_\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{r}_\mathbf{b}.
\end{equation}

Said differently, a vanishing point can be traced from two 2D line segments
which backprojects to 3D parallel planes.
