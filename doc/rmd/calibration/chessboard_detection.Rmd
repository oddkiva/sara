## Chessboard Based Calibration

This approach assumes that we know the camera model, and aims at optimizing the
parameters associated to the camera model by exploiting correspondences between
the 2D image points and its corresponding 3D scene points of the x-corners of
the chessboard.

One task is to detect the chessboard x-corners. As deceptively simple as the
chessboard may be, this computer vision task can turn unexpectedly challenging
when we are faced with unexpected imaging conditions.

What makes the detection of the chessboard hard are the following issues:

- the motion blur due to sudden movements during the filming process;
- a sudden exposure to the sun while filming the chessboard can drastically
  change the lighting conditions;
- a dirty camera lens, which then creates lots of signal noise;
- a dirty or damaged chessboard pattern, which also creates lots of signal
  noise.

These are what complicates the design of a reliable chessboard detection
algorithm.

In this book, I will present my chessboard detection algorithm and my personal
recipes to robustify the chessboard detection.

Alternative chessboard detection algorithms available online:

- `OpenCV` [@opencv] provides a chessboard detection method. Originally designed
  by [@Vezhnevets] , and later improved by [@RufliSS:2008:iros], it can work
  very well on easy conditions. However, it is not always possible the
  conditions under which the video data is being acquired. This becomes a major
  problem when businesses ship software to clients who know very little about
  computer vision and who then expect the algorithms to just work.

  In challenging lighting conditions, OpenCVâ€™s method will tend to break. Most
  annoyingly, it requires the chessboard to be visible in full and will not even
  output a partially detected chessboard. With the default parameters, the
  chessboard detector becomes slow to the point of being unusable when the
  chessboard is not visible in the images. While we can speed up OpenCVâ€™s
  algorithm with a faster check option, I have found that the detection rate
  degrades dramatically.

- `libcbdetect` is designed by [@Geiger:2012:icra] and turns out to be a strong and
  robust alternative. Still the recovery of the grid structure can still fail
  badly under challenging conditions.

- `BoofCV` [@BoofCV] also provides a chessboard detection algorithm
  [@Abeles:2021:corr] and outperforms `libcbdetect`.

Initially I wanted to design a new chessboard detector in order not to depend on
`OpenCV` and I still wanted to investigate myself whether I could come out with
a good enough alternative. `libcbdetect` could have been an excellent choice,
unfortunately its GPL-licensing made it a no-go for me. I decided to not use
`BoofCV` since I donâ€™t program in Java.

Let us distinguish OpenCV's method and the other methods in how they operate.

OpenCVâ€™s method depends on the adaptive Gaussian thresholding method to binarize
the image. It then localizes the chessboard black squares by repeatedly applying
the morphological erosion. Let us highlight the merits and disadvantages of this
approach. First, while very simple and computationally efficient approach, the
adaptive thresholding tends to fail at providing a satisfactory image
binarization on challenging lighting conditions. Second, the repeated use of the
morphological erosion to separate and distinguish black squares is both
ingeneous and awkward at the same time. This entails finding a compromise
between localizing all the chessboard black squares and the accuracy in the
localization of chessboard x-corners. Most of the time this is mitigated by the
refinement of corner location via Forstner's optimization method, but in some
cases, the final location of chessboard corners can be off by a few pixels.

The other approaches instead base themselves on the robust detection of
x-corners and then performs a structure recovery via a region growing approach.
One very attractive feature is that they can detect multiple chessboards in the
images contrary to OpenCV.
Relying on corner detection works better against to challenging lighting
condition. However because they don't detect the chessboard squares and don't
exploit the topological structure of the chessboard as much as in OpenCV's
method, they may still fail at correctly recover the grid structure of the
chessboard.


My personal approach still relies on corner detection. By filtering the edges
and parsing them, it is possible to recover both black and white squares of the
chessboard. This will greatly ease the recovery of the grid structure, which is
proceeded by region growing as well. Instead of relying on the geometric
constraints as in Geiger et al. approach, will fail badly to recover the grid
structure on tricky cases.

### The Chessboard Calibration Method

I have devised a chessboard detection algorithm that is designed to work well on
HD resolution and above 4K resolutions without any parameter tuning.
Such image resolution are pretty much standard in consumer cameras, such as
GoPro. For resolution lower than 960x540, by tuning two parameters it is
possible to obtain correct detection results.

Detecting x-corner can be done via several mathematical operators:

- Traditionally, corners are detected by localizing local maxima of Harrisâ€™s
  cornerness function, which collapses the structure tensor matrix as a score
  function [@HarrisS:1988:alvey].
- Likewise Forstner cornerness approach will give the strongest response in
  points that are most orthogonal to local gradients, and is in this regards
  related to Harrisâ€™s cornerness function.
- Another approach is to view x-corner as a saddle point which the Hessian
  operator responds as a local minima [@Geiger:2012:icra] suggest to construct
  template filter which x-corners would respond maximally.
- Abeles designed a faster corner detector than Harris.

#### Multiscale Harris's Corner Detection

I have decided to stick with Harrisâ€™s cornerness operator. I still found it to
be very versatile and also works for deltille based pattern, a.k.a. the monkey
saddle-point. Harris's corners are still robust and sufficiently accurate if we
set the detection parameters with care. As the localization of corners are
quantized, we polish their location using Forstner junction refinement method,
similarly to all available chessboard detection methods.

As [@Abeles:2021:corr] advocated it, a multiscale corner detector is the best
way to detect chessboard corners robustly against blur. As illustrated in his
report [@Abeles:2021:corr], BoofCV detects chessboard corners across 4 different
scales. Geiger et al. also do the same but limited themselves to only 2 scales,
which is one of the reasons why [@Abeles:2021:corr]'s method was able to outperform
[@Geiger:2012:icra]. In terms of speed, the method [@Abeles:2021:corr] is implemented in
Java is faster than the original MATLAB implementation libcbdetect. However,
there exists an unofficial OpenCV C++ implementation available on GitHub:
[https://github.com/ftdlyc/libcbdetect], so it may be worth comparing it
again.^[No, no, no, don't count on me to do it, I don't care and don't have
time. Anyways all comparative tests are designed to be misleading and at some
point I would try to claim that my algorithmic approach is better and bla bla
bla... ðŸ˜›]

In my approach, I do the same and detect corners at 3 different scales by
default. This gives good results in my experience and is sufficient
experimentally. The method allows to select larger number of scales but more
than 3 scales brings little benefit. Typically, when the motion blur is very
strong, x-corners responds better at the coarsest scale than at the finest
scales. At scale levels of 4 and above, the localization of x-corners carries a
lot more uncertainty and then chessboard corners tends to be less well localized
which make them less useful for the purpose of accurate camera calibration.


#### Corner filtering

Harris's corner detector detects a lot of noisy corners which are not the
chessboard x-corners of interest.

Experimentally I have found three filtering strategies that worked very well at
weeding out those spurious corners.

In the following order, the three filtering strategies are successively applied.

- A scale-aware non maximum suppression
- A topological edge analysis where:
  1. we employ Canny's edge detector and group edgels into into smooth edge
     curves;
  2. edges with a mean gradient magnitude lower than 0.02 are discarded. This
     has the benefit of keeping relevant edge curves, most of which being
     edges of a chessboard square;
  3. corners that are not close to the endpoints of the curves are discarded
- A circular intensity profile extractor that combines both [@Abeles:2021:corr]
  and [@Geiger:2012:icra]'s ideas. The spoke pattern described in
  [@Abeles:2021:corr] turns out to be the key idea in order to get a fairly
  robust corner filtering.

#### Square Parsing
TODO.

#### Recovery of the Grid Structure
TODO.


### Mathematical Optimization Method

Similar to the bundle adjustment, the mathematical optimization consists in minimizing the reprojection of the 3D points of the chessboard x-corners to the camera image plane.

One first difficulty is to first initialize the pose of the chessboard plane
with respect to the camera frame. The initialization of the rotation and
position of the chessboard turn out to be critical to avoid the optimizer being
stuck in a bad local minimum.

We can employ a couple heuristics to identify images where the chessboard pose
is close to the identity, to ensure a good guess of the intrinsic parameters.
Once we have more confidence about the intrisic parameters, we can employ one
proven PnP algorithm to better initialize the pose of the chessboard.
