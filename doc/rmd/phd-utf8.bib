              and the existence of an efficient optimal algorithm has been posed
              as an open problem in a number of recent papers. We show how the
              difficulties encountered by previous approaches are overcome by
              the use of a self-concordant potential function.  Our approach

  title = {A Probabilistic Approach to the Semantic Interpretation of Building
           Facades - Georgia Tech's Institutional Repository},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {We present a probabilistic image-based approach to the semantic
              interpretation of building facades. We are motivated by the 4D
              Atlanta project at Georgia Tech, which aims to create a system
              that takes a collection of historical imagery of a city and infers
              a 3D model parameterized by time. Here it is necessary to recover,
              from historical imagery, metric and semantic information about
              buildings that might no longer exist or have undergone extensive
              change. Current approaches to automated 3D model reconstruction
              typically recover only geometry, and a systematic approach that
              allows hierarchical classification of structural elements is still
              largely missing. We extract metric and semantic information from
              images of facades, allowing us to decode the structural elements
              in them and their inter-relationships, thus providing access to
              highly structured descriptions of buildings. Our method is based
              on constructing a Bayesian generative model from stochastic
              context-free grammars that encode knowledge about facades. This
              model combines low-level segmentation and high-level hierarchical
              labelling so that the levels reinforce each other and produce a
              detailed hierarchical partition of the depicted facade into
              structural blocks. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is used to
              approximate the posterior over partitions given an image.},

	the problem of identifying the object content of natural images while
	generalizing across variations inherent to the object class. This
	bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine
	invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two
	alternative implementations using different classifiers: Na\"{i}ve
	Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple,
	computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present
	results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories.
	These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background
	clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting
	geometric information. 1.},

	the corresponding hypergraph matching problem is formulated as the
	maximization of a multilinear objective function over all permutations
	of the features. This function is defined by a tensor representing
	the affinity between feature tuples. It is maximized using a generalization
	of spectral techniques where a relaxed problem is first solved by
	a multi-dimensional power method, and the solution is then projected
	onto the closest assignment matrix. The proposed approach has been
	implemented, and it is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on

  abstract = {{The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward
	Selection, and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on
	the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied.
	Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates
	from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the eificient
	pre-diction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression ( \&amp;quot;
	LARS\&amp;quot;), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and
	less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three
	main properties are derived. (1) A simple modification of the LARS
	algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of Ordinary
	Least Squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression
	coeificients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso
	estimates for a given problem in an order of magnitude less computer
	time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification eificiently
	implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising
	new model selection method; this connection explains the similar
	numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise,
	and helps understand the properties of both methods, which are seen}},

	to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold
	determined by the constraints. As t â†’ âˆž the solution converges
	to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm
	is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art
	for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp
	edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first
	step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with
	velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude
	of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the
	image back onto the constraint set.}},

  title = {Early Processing of Visual Information},
  journal = {Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series
	B, Biological Sciences},
  year = {1976},

  abstract = {An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing.
	The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images
	at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of
	consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the
	grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed
	in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change ({EDGE}, {SHADING}-{EDGE},
	{EXTENDED}-{EDGE}, {LINE}, {BLOB} etc.). Modifying parameters are
	bound to the elements in the description, specifying their {POSITION},
	{ORIENTATION}, {TERMINATION} points, {CONTRAST}, {SIZE} and {FUZZINESS}.
	This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques,
	and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch
	is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information
	processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate
	for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with
	little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual
	equipment of symbolic processes that can define 'placetokens' in
	an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain
	rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping
	phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction
	rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements
	in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available
	the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select
	items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters.
	Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information
	about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is
	argued that 'non-attentive' vision is in practice implemented by
	these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting
	on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs
	slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity
	array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these
	techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is
	concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using
	techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question.
	Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description
	of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level
	knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions
	taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of
	downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current
	machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence
	the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing
	that is taking place lower down.},

@ARTICLE{Marr:1976:ptrsl,
  author = {Marr, D.},
  title = {Early Processing of Visual Information},
  journal = {Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series
	B, Biological Sciences},
  year = {1976},
  volume = {275},
  pages = {483--519},

  abstract = {An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing.
	The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images
	at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of
	consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the
	grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed
	in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change ({EDGE}, {SHADING}-{EDGE},
	{EXTENDED}-{EDGE}, {LINE}, {BLOB} etc.). Modifying parameters are
	bound to the elements in the description, specifying their {POSITION},
	{ORIENTATION}, {TERMINATION} points, {CONTRAST}, {SIZE} and {FUZZINESS}.
	This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques,
	and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch
	is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information
	processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate
	for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with
	little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual
	equipment of symbolic processes that can define 'placetokens' in
	an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain
	rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping
	phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction
	rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements
	in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available
	the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select
	items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters.
	Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information
	about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is
	argued that 'non-attentive' vision is in practice implemented by
	these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting
	on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs
	slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity
	array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these
	techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is
	concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using
	techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question.
	Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description
	of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level
	knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions
	taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of
	downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current
	machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence
	the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing
	that is taking place lower down.},

	for that the use of the {VC}-dimension of the level sets of the fitness
	functions; results are then obtained through the use of {S}auer's
	lemma. {I}n the special case of optmization of the sphere function,
	improved lower bounds are obtained by bounding the possible number
	of sign conditions realized by some systems of equations. {T}he results
