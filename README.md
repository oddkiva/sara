Sara: C++ Computer Vision Library
=================================

[![GitLab CI Build Status](https://gitlab.com/DO-CV/sara/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/DO-CV/sara/-/pipelines)
[![GitHub Actions Status](https://github.com/oddkiva/sara/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/oddkiva/sara/actions)

*Sara* (सार) is a Sanskrit word meaning *essence*.

*Sara* tries to focus on:

1. having an **easy-to-use and simple API**;
2. having **easy-to-understand and efficient** implementations of computer vision
   algorithms;

*Sara* is licensed with the [Mozilla Public License version
2.0](https://gitlab.com/oddkiva/sara/-/raw/master/LICENSE?ref_type=heads).


Documentation
-------------

You can find the API documentation [here](https://oddkiva.gitlab.io/sara/).

I also compile my personal notes [here](https://oddkiva.gitlab.io/sara-book/)
where I write down my understanding regarding the mathematical details to
explain how I implement some algorithms.

In any case, you are always better off consulting the [examples
folder](https://gitlab.com/oddkiva/sara/tree/master/cpp/examples) and the [test
folder](https://gitlab.com/oddkiva/sara/tree/master/cpp/test).


Why yet another library?
------------------------

Like a few people out there, I never really liked OpenCV. I use it out of
necessity but I don't really like it.

Of course, you will not want to use my library and use *OpenCV* instead, and
that's fine.

The two aspects below are always in my mind everytime I write code for this
library:
1. as a computer vision scientist, understanding as many algorithms as possible
   and as deeply as possible is one of my responsibilities .
2. I also try to write clear and efficient code.

This is a library made out of love and I try to reflect this mindset as honestly
as possible.


Build the libraries
-------------------

Please have a look at the CI scripts like `.gitlab-ci.yml` or
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

If something does not work, help me and try fixing it? =P
