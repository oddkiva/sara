# Kalman Filter

The Kalman Filter is a mathematical method that is usually utilized to track a
physical object of interest.

For example, let us suppose we are tracking pedestrians to ensure their road
safety.

One important aspect to note with the Kalman filter is that it not only gives
predicts the next state of the object but it also provides how wrong we could be
in our prediction. How wrong we could be is quantified in terms of covariance
matrix?

So when we predict the next state of the object, we actually predict a Gaussian
distribution.

Let's start reminding ourselves the equations.
