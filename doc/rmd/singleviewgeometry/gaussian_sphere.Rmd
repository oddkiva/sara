*On a quiet Sunday, you are walking in the park while sipping your coffee all
along. Your mind is being distracted by the birds chirping on the branches. You
notice a trail reserved for train workers. Out of curiosity, you walk that way
leading to deeper woods. At the end of the trail, you discover train rails
dividing the forest in two parts. The wild scenery is pleasant and you can't
resist taking a picture of the straight train rails at the center. They vanish
at a point far away in the horizon.*

## Backprojection

In projective geometry, the projection of 3D lines in the camera film plane are
still line segments. However, the perspective projection does not preserve the
parallelism.

To make things clear in our mind, images are thus formed by some pinhole camera
model with calibration matrix $\mathbf{K}$.

One remarkable property in projective geometry is that the projection of 3D
parallel lines onto an image plane is a set of 2D lines that intersect
altogether into a unique point: the so-called *vanishing point*.

Let us recall a bit of terminology.

- Any 3D scene point $X$ that lies in a 3D semi-line originating from the camera
  center $O$ **projects** exactly on a unique point $\mathbf{u}$ in the image
  plane.

We also like to say the other way around, in 3D reconstruction:

- A point $\mathbf{u}$ in the image plane **backprojects** to a 3D semi-line or
  equivalently to the 3D ray vector $\mathbf{r}_\mathbf{u}$ that parameterizes
  this semi-line.

Now let us take it further.

- A 2D line segment $(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b})$ in the image plane backprojects to
  a 3D half-plane $(\mathbf{O}, \mathbf{r}_\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{r}_\mathbf{b})$
  where $\mathbf{r}_\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{r}_\mathbf{b}$ are respectively the
  backprojected rays of the 2D image points $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$.

- The half-plane $(\mathbf{O}, \mathbf{r}_\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{r}_\mathbf{b})$
  can be parameterized by its normal vector $\mathbf{\Pi}(\mathbf{a},
  \mathbf{b})$^[Let's omit the side of the half-plane for now, which can be
  retrieved via a cheirality criterion], which we calculate as

  \begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\Pi}(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) =
    \mathbf{r}_\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{r}_\mathbf{b}.
  \end{equation}

- Note that the backprojected rays are thus calculated as

  \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{r}_\mathbf{a} &= \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{a} \\
    %
    \mathbf{r}_\mathbf{b} &= \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{b}.
  \end{align*}

- Another way to calculate the plane normal is to calculate the line
  $\mathbf{l} = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ from the image line segment
  $(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b})$ (expressed in homogeneous coordinates), and then:

  \begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\Pi}(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) =
    \mathbf{K}^T \mathbf{l}.
  \end{equation}

  $\mathbf{K}^T \mathbf{l}$ is the plane backprojected from the 2D image line $\mathbf{l}$.

  :::{proof}
  $\mathbf{K}^T \mathbf{l}$ is indeed the normal of the backprojected plane
  because it is orthogonal to both backprojected rays $\mathbf{K}^{-1}
  \mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{b}$.

  Indeed, let us write the dot product for $\mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{a}$

  \begin{equation}
    (\mathbf{K}^T \mathbf{l})^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{a} =
    \mathbf{l}^T \mathbf{K} \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{a} = 0
  \end{equation}

  and likewise for $\mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{b}$, the dot product is $0$.

  Since the backprojected rays form a linear span of the backprojected plane,
  any point on the backprojected plane is a linear combination of the
  backprojected rays is therefore orthogonal to $\mathbf{K}^T \mathbf{n}$.
  ```

## Vanishing Point

This concept is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:train-rails).

A vanishing point can be traced from two "parallel" 2D line segments $l_1$ and
$l_2$. These 2D line segments backproject to two 3D planes $\mathbf{\Pi}(l_1)$
and $\mathbf{\Pi}(l_2)$ that intersect at the camera center.

But also, because the intersection of two non parallel 3D planes must be a 3D
line in general, their intersection is calculated as the cross-product

  \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\Pi}(l_1) \times \mathbf{\Pi}(l_2).
  \end{equation}

This cross-product is exactly the backprojected ray of the vanishing point.
Let's call it the vanishing ray.

As a side note:

- the dual representation of a 3D vector is the plane orthogonal to the
  vector itself;
- thus in particular, the dual representation of a vanishing ray is the plane
  orthogonal to the vanishing ray itself.

Finally, two vanishing points in the images are orthogonal if they backproject to two
orthogonal vectors. We can retrieve the third orthogonal ray by calculating the
cross-product of the two orthogonal vectors.

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\Pi}(l_3) = \mathbf{\Pi}(l_1) \times \mathbf{\Pi}(l_2).
\end{equation}

## Vanishing Line

*The nature lover in you escaped the stress of the big city and found temporary
refuge at the beach. Standing at the shore, your mind is being rejuvenated by
the appeasing sound of ocean waves. A few birds are floating peacefully on the
sea. Not a single boat is there to disturb the quiet infiniteness of the sea.
Only the horizon, this imaginary line, seems to separate the water and the air.
You can't help but wonder how on earth the sea looks so strangely flat?*

The horizon which we depicted in the text above and which can be seen in the YouTube
video is a vanishing line. As explained in the terminology section, the
vanishing line backprojects to a 3D plane which we can calculate.

Assuming we know the calibration matrix $\mathbf{K}$ of the camera that shot
this YouTube video, we can calculate the equation of the backprojected plane
video.

Indeed let us pick two image points in homogeneous coordinates $\mathbf{a}$ and
$\mathbf{b}$, the normal of the associated line segments calculated by the
cross-product $\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$.

The equation of the backprojected sea surface in 3D is therefore

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\Pi}_\textrm{sea} = \mathbf{K}^T (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}).
\end{equation}

The normal of the sea surface is expressed in the camera frame, which we indeed
expect it to be equal approximately $y = \mathbf{constant}$.


## Orthogonal Vanishing Point Detection

The detection of orthogonal vanishing point assumes that cameras are calibrated,
that is we understand how the images are formed and know the camera parameters.
We know not just the calibration matrix, but also its distortion model and its
distortion coefficients.

In the following, let's simplify the ideas. We assume the camera follows the
pinhole model and that we know its calibration matrix $\mathbf{K}$.

We can then derive an algorithm to compute the reference frame of a Manhattan
world with respect to the camera frame. To do so, we employ RANSAC to draw
minimal samples of 3 line segments. From there, we are able to infer the
orientation of the camera with respect to the Manhattan world frame and
vice-versa.

This approach is described more in details in the paper [@BazinP:2012:iros].
Basically, the main idea is as follows. A good sample of 3 line segments is a sample
such that

- The first two image line segments are parallel and are used to construct a
  first vanishing point.
- The third line segment vanishes to a second vanishing point, which should be
  orthogonal to the first vanishing point.
- The third orthogonal vanishing point is obtained by cross-product.
In that case, the three orthogonal vanishing points are well supported by the
other line segments.
