## Corner and Junction Detection

The corner detection relies on the analysis of one statistical object called the
structure tensor.

In each point of the image, we want to describe its shape locally on a
small region.

With the structure tensor, we can to classify each of these small regions
into three categories:

1. Is it a uniform region?
2. Is the small region more like an edge? Can we calculate its orientation?
3. Is the small region more like a corner? Can we calculate its orientation?

Thus we build the structure tensor by accumulating all the image gradients into
a second moment matrix.

### Structure Tensor

Formally we define the structure tensor as

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{M} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \int_\mathbf{x} w(\mathbf{x}) \frac{\partial I(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x}^2 d\mathbf{x}&&
    %
    \int_\mathbf{x} w(\mathbf{x})
    \frac{\partial I(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x} \frac{\partial I(\mathbf{x})}{\partial y} d\mathbf{x}\\
    %
    \int_\mathbf{x} w(\mathbf{x})
    \frac{\partial I(\mathbf{x})}{\partial x} \frac{\partial I(\mathbf{x})}{\partial y} d\mathbf{x} &&
    %
    \int_\mathbf{x} w(\mathbf{x}) \frac{\partial I(\mathbf{x})}{\partial y}^2 d\mathbf{x}\\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

We can rewrite this with a bit of linear algebra

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{M} = \displaystyle \int_\mathbf{x} w(\mathbf{x})
    \nabla I(\mathbf{x}) \nabla I(\mathbf{x})^T
    d\mathbf{x}
\end{equation}

This form is convenient from an implementation point of view.

By extracting the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can calculate the two
principal directions of the gradients, that is, those that appears most
frequently, and then compare the "frequency" ratio between the two principal
directions

### Spiral Model

I learnt from [@ForstnerDS:2009:iccv] that the spiral model is an extension of
the structure tensor. This time, the structure is also parameterized with a 2D
rotation matrix parameterized by an angle $\alpha$ in the structure tensor.

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{M}(\alpha) = \displaystyle \int_\mathbf{x} w(\mathbf{x})
  \mathbf{R}_\alpha \nabla I(\mathbf{x})
  \nabla I(\mathbf{x})^T
  \mathbf{R}_\alpha^T
  d\mathbf{x}
\end{equation}
