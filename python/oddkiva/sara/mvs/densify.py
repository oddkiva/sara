# FACILE.
# Collect all absolute camera pose for each image.
# Detect all feature matches
# Match feature matches when their epipolar distances is small
# Triangulate to retrieve the 3D points.

# PAS CLAIR ET FAIRE A MA SAUCE.
# Incremental point cloud construction for tetrahedralization.
# Each 3D point contains meta info from which image they come from.
# Closest vertex in the tetrahedralization stores these.


# Graph Cut to carve the volume.
# tetrahedron marked as visible or non visible.


# PDE to refine the mesh.
# Poisson surface reconstruction.
