Welcome to Sara's documentation!
================================

*Sara* is a small and easy-to-use C++ computer vision library.

*Sara* (सार) is a *Sanskrit* word meaning *essence*. On a less serious note, I
was looking for a nice simple *human* name and intentionally chose this
transliteration into this lovely Spanish girl name.

Sara focuses on:

1. having an **easy-to-use and simple API**,
2. having **human-readable and efficient** implementations of computer vision
   algorithms,
3. **rigorous testing**.

Sara is licensed with the `Mozilla Public License version
2.0 <https://github.com/DO-CV/DO-CV/raw/master/COPYING.MPL2>`_.

The documentation chooses to emphasize on the mathematical details regarding my
implementations. Most of the time, I believe that my API is most of the time
straightforward enough. In this documentation, the audience I am targeting is
students, scientists or software developers who want to understand these of
details.


For the reference API documentation, I invite you to refer to the
**Doxygen**-based documentation hosted `here at Codedocs.xyz`_:

Obviously I cannot compete with OpenCV in terms of library completeness, still
there might be a couple of appreciable knowledge you can gain from reading
Sara's documentation, should you become interested.
