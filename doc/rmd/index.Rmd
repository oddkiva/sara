# Welcome {-}

*Sara* is a small and easy-to-use C++ computer vision library.

*Sara* (सार) is a *Sanskrit* word meaning *essence*. On a less serious note, I was
looking for a nice simple *human* name and the Spanish transliteration into this
lovely female name was then chosen intentionally.

Sara focuses on:

1. having an **easy-to-use and simple API**,
2. having **human-readable and efficient** implementations of computer vision
   algorithms,
3. **rigorous testing**.

Sara is licensed with the _[Mozilla Public License version
2.0](https://gitlab.com/DO-CV/sara/-/blob/master/LICENSE)_.


The documentation chooses to emphasize more on the mathematical details to
explain some algorithmic implementation. I believe that my API is most of the
time straightforward enough. The audience I am targeting here is students,
scientists or software developers who want to understand those kind of details.

For the reference API documentation, refer to the **Doxygen**-based
documentation hosted at Codedocs.xyz: https://codedocs.xyz/DO-CV/sara/.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
codedocs_url = 'https://codedocs.xyz/DO-CV/sara.svg'
if (!file.exists(codedocs_file <- 'sara.svg'))
  download.file(codedocs_url, codedocs_file, mode = 'wb')

include_svg = function(path) {
  if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
    output = xfun::with_ext(path, 'pdf')
    # you can compare the timestamp of pdf against svg to avoid conversion if necessary
    system2('rsvg-convert', c('-f', 'pdf', '-a', '-o', shQuote(c(output, path))))
  } else {
    output = path
  }
  knitr::include_graphics(output)
}
```

[`r include_svg(if (identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html')) codedocs_url else codedocs_file)`](https://codedocs.xyz/DO-CV/sara/)

*N.B.: these notes reflect the best of my understanding as of this writing. They
may still contain errors and I am very interested to know about them if you spot
any misunderstandings on my part and explain to me.*
