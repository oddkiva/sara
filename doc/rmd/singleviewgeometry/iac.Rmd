## Plane at Infinity

[@HartleyZ:2003:mvg] use the term plane at infinity $\mathbf{\Pi}_\infty$ in
projective geometry. This plane $\mathbf{\Pi}_\infty$ is the set of points $[x,
y, z, 0]^T$ in the $3$-space.

Basically, these are nothing more than **3D rays** or **3D vectors**.

## Absolute conic

The absolute conic is by definition the set of imaginary 3D rays $(x, y, z,
0) \in \mathbb{C}^4$ such that

\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix} x & y & z \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\
                  0 & 1 & 0 \\
                  0 & 0 & 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}
  = 0
\end{equation}

## Image of the Absolute Conic

In a nutshell, suppose we know the calibration matrix $\mathbf{K}$ of some pinhole camera.

Suppose we have two orthogonal 3D unit rays $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$. They
form a right angle, and thus their dot product is zero:

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y} = 0
\end{equation}

They project onto the image plane at two orthogonal vanishing points
$\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{K} \mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{K} \mathbf{y}$.

In other words,
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{u}^T (\mathbf{K}^{-T} \mathbf{K}^T) \mathbf{y} = 0
\end{equation}

[@HartleyZ:2003:mvg] defines this $3\times3$ matrix as the **Image of the Absolute Conic** (IAC)
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\Omega}_\infty = \mathbf{K}^{-T} \mathbf{K}^T$
\end{equation}

The IAC is an interesting matrix because it can tell us if two image
points $\mathbf{u}$, $\mathbf{v}$ backproject to 3D orthogonal rays
$\mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}$.

More than that, whether or not they backproject to two orthogonal rays, we can
measure the angle between the backprojected rays as

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{arccos}
  \left(
    \frac{\mathbf{u}^T \mathbf{K}^{-T} \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}}
    {\| \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{u} \| \| \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v} \|}
  \right)
\end{equation}

That is why [@HartleyZ:2003:mvg] says that the IAC acts like a 3D protractor
between 2 image points.

- If we know 3 orthogonal vanishing points, then we know the IAC and then we can
  determine the calibration matrix.
- If we know 1 vanishing point and its orthogonal vanishing line, then we also
  know the IAC and then we can determine the calibration matrix.
