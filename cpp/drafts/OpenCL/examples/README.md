The 'hello' examples are readapted from the (excellent) resource:
https://learnopengl.com/

Instead of simply recopying the code from the educational resource, more
emphasis is put in summarising the main ideas of each sample code. After
understanding the implementation details, a refactoring exercise is done to
transform pieces of the original code into more reusable blocks or functions.
