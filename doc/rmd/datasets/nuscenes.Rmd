## nuScenes

Similar to the KITTI dataset, the nuScenes dataset has been made available . The
novelty here is that the data is much larger and is acquired from a multi-camera
setup supplemented with LIDAR, RADAR, IMU/GPU sensors. KITTI also contains LIDAR
data and IMU/GPS data but no RADAR data, no CAN bus data.

So with nuScenes, in addition to the usual 2D and 3D bounding boxes and point
clouds, we also have at our disposal ground-truth velocity data for each
detected objects and a richer set of information regarding the car egomotion.

### Concepts and Data Organization

Given that the data acquired in nuScenes is much richer and more complex, I
believe it is important to know what the different data definitions are in
nuScenes and how they are organized.

On a first approach, a complete data sample is fully characterized by:

- a timestamp;
- the images acquired from the 6 cameras- point cloud acquired from the lidar device
- calibration data acquired from the lidar device
- velocity data acquired from the radar device

Now because each sensor is sampling data asynchronously and at different
acquisition rate, each sampled data (image, point cloud, etc.) is matched to the
sample timestamp if its acquisition time is closest to this sample timestamp.

A common category of data termed *Sample Data* is either an image, a point cloud
or a velocity data (and so on.).

Similarly to *KITTI*, a *Data Annotation* is basically a road user or other
object detection for which we know its 3D geometry.

### API Replication for C++

Being a hardcore C++ user myself, my goal is to replicate the Python API data in
my own way, which is available online. Based on my experience with KITTI, it can
be a good case study to understand how the data is structured without having to
go line-by-line the Python API.

A typical pattern which the the data tables in nuScenes dataset follows is that:

- Each row of a any table is referenced by a UUID termed as "token" in
  nuScenes terminology.
  From a data structure point of view, each row can be stored as a hash
  table.

- Each table can also be viewed as a doubly-linked list because of "prev"
  and "next" fields.
